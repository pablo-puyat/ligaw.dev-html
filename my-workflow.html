      <h1>A Productive Workflow for the Independent Developer</h1>
      <p>
        As an independent developer, focused time is the most valuable resource.
        Juggling features, bugs, and project management drains productivity.
        This tool-driven workflow provides structure without administrative
        overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process uses GitHub and Sentry to track issues and handle
        production errors efficiently. It's a cost-effective system for
        producing quality work.
      </p>

      <h2>Development Loop: Idea to Production</h2>
      <p>
        This cycle covers all planned work, ensuring every change is deliberate
        and tracked.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>1. Task Capture (GitHub Issues)</h3>
          <p>
            All work begins as a GitHub Issue. This creates a centralized
            backlog without detailed specifications. Capturing an idea with a
            title (e.g., feat: Add user profile page) takes seconds and clears
            mental overhead, allowing focus to return to the current task.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2. Execution (Branching)</h3>
          <p>
            All work is done on a dedicated branch from main. This isolates
            changes, protects the main codebase, and links the work to its issue
            (e.g., 42/add-profile-page).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>3. Merging and Automation (Squash and Merge)</h3>
          <p>
            When work is complete, a Pull Request is opened. Using "Squash and
            Merge" condenses all changes into a single commit on the main
            branch.
          </p>
          <p>
            The commit message includes a keyword (e.g., Fixes #42) to
            automatically close the GitHub Issue. This maintains a clean project
            history and automates the final step.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Error Management: Alert to Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        Unplanned work, like production errors, requires a structured process to
        avoid derailing development.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>1. Triage and Delegate (Sentry to GitHub)</h3>
          <p>
            When Sentry reports a production error, assess its impact. If it's a
            real bug, convert it to a GitHub Issue directly from Sentry with one
            click. This moves the error and its technical context into the
            backlog. Archive the Sentry alert to keep the inbox clean.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2. Automated Resolution (Sentry Releases)</h3>
          <p>
            The bug is then handled using the core development loop. The key is
            using "Releases." Every deployment is tagged with a unique
            identifier (like a git commit hash).
          </p>
          <p>
            When the fix is deployed, Sentry detects the new release. Since the
            Sentry alert was linked to the GitHub Issue, Sentry automatically
            marks the error as resolved. This closes the loop without manual
            intervention.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Automation Setup</h2>
      <p>This workflow is powered by a one-time configuration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          GitHub & Sentry Integration: Install the Sentry application on the
          GitHub repository to allow communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          Release Tagging: Modify the deployment script to pass a release
          identifier (e.g., a git hash) to the Sentry SDK on initialization.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This setup enables a highly automated workflow, providing a clear link
        between code, features, and resolved errors.
      </p>
