      <h1>Streamlining Web Development: My Journey to a Monorepo Structure</h1>

      <p>
        As a solo web developer, managing the complexities of multiple
        repositories for a single web application project can be daunting. My
        recent project – a robust web application requiring a WebAssembly (WASM)
        module, dynamic landing pages, and a REST backend – presented me with a
        significant challenge in terms of manageability. This led me to explore
        the world of monorepos, a journey I embarked on to streamline my
        development process.
      </p>

      <h3>The Decision to Switch to a Monorepo</h3>

      <p>
        In the past, juggling multiple code repositories for different segments
        of the project was becoming increasingly cumbersome. The main components
        of my project included a web application and landing pages, both
        developed using Svelte, along with a separate REST backend. The
        redundancy in handling similar structures across repositories prompted
        me to seek a simpler, more efficient approach.
      </p>

      <h3>Choosing the Right Tool: npm Workspaces</h3>

      <p>
        After weighing my options, I chose to implement my monorepo using npm
        Workspaces. While Yarn was also a contender, my familiarity with npm and
        its straightforward integration with my existing workflow made it the
        ideal choice. I was aware of other tools like DX and Narwhal, but I
        found that they added unnecessary complexity, whereas my priority was
        simplicity.
      </p>

      <h2>Transitioning to a Monorepo: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

      <h3>1. Preparing the Existing Repository:</h3>

      <p>
        I started by creating a new branch in my existing repository to retain
        my code history. I moved my existing code, including package.json and
        various configuration files, into a subfolder within the project.

      <h3>2. Configuring npm Workspaces:</h3>

      <p>
        I created a root package.json file and specified my web application as
        the first workspace.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Streamlining Dependencies and Scripts:</h3>

      <p>
        Next, I shifted shared dependencies and scripts from my web
        application's package.json to the root package.json. This involved
        modifying the scripts to function correctly within the new structure.

      <h3>4. Adding the Second Workspace:</h3>

      <p>
        For the landing pages, I added a second entry to the root package.json
        and set up a corresponding subfolder. I used SvelteKit for these static
        HTML pages, inheriting shared dependencies from the root.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Implementing Landing Pages:</h3>

      <p>
        With the setup in place, I easily ran npm run dev:landing-pages and
        quickly developed two landing pages.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion: Embracing the Monorepo</h2>

      <p>
        The switch to a monorepo has significantly simplified my workflow. Not
        only has it made my codebase more manageable, but it has also allowed me
        to maintain a cleaner, more organized structure. As I continue to work
        with this setup, the benefits of a monorepo in terms of efficiency and
        manageability are increasingly apparent.
      </p>

      <p>
        For fellow developers considering this transition, I can confidently say
        that the journey to a monorepo, though initially daunting, is well worth
        the effort for the simplicity and coherence it brings to your projects.
